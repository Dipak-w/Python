print('''➦ 1. LLMs (Large Language Models)

This is the core of almost every AI product right now. think ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini.
To be valuable here, you need to:

→Design great prompts (zero-shot, CoT, role-based)
→Fine-tune models (LoRA, QLoRA, PEFT, this is how you adapt LLMs for your use case)
→Understand embeddings for smarter search and context
→Master function calling (hooking models up to tools/APIs in your stack)
→Handle hallucinations (trust me, this is a must in prod)

Tools: OpenAI GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, Hugging Face Transformers, Cohere

➦ 2. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
This is the backbone of every AI assistant/chatbot that needs to answer questions with real data (not just model memory).

Key skills:
-Chunking & indexing docs for vector DBs
-Building smart search/retrieval pipelines
-Injecting context on the fly (dynamic context)
-Multi-source data retrieval (APIs, files, web scraping)
-Prompt engineering for grounded, truthful responses

Tools: FAISS, Pinecone, LangChain, Weaviate, ChromaDB, Haystack

➦ 3. Agentic AI & AI Agents
Forget single bots. The future is teams of agents coordinating to get stuff done, think automated research, scheduling, or workflows.

What to learn:
-Agent design (planner/executor/researcher roles)
-Long-term memory (episodic, context tracking)
-Multi-agent communication & messaging
-Feedback loops (self-improvement, error handling)
-Tool orchestration (using APIs, CRMs, plugins)

Tools: CrewAI, LangGraph, AgentOps, FlowiseAI, Superagent, ReAct Framework

➦ 4. AI Engineer
You need to be able to ship, not just prototype.

Get good at:
-Designing & orchestrating AI workflows (combine LLMs + tools + memory)
-Deploying models and managing versions
-Securing API access & gateway management
-CI/CD for AI (test, deploy, monitor)
-Cost and latency optimization in prod
-Responsible AI (privacy, explainability, fairness)

Tools: Docker, FastAPI, Hugging Face Hub, Vercel, LangSmith, OpenAI API, Cloudflare Workers, GitHub Copilot

➦ 5. ML Engineer

Old-school but essential. AI teams always need:
-Data cleaning & feature engineering
-Classical ML (XGBoost, SVM, Trees)
-Deep learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
-Model evaluation & cross-validation
-Hyperparameter optimization
-MLOps (tracking, deployment, experiment logging)
-Scaling on cloud
